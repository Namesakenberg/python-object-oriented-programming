 FlexibleDict
As of now we are accessing values from dictionary with exact keys. Now we want to amend accessing values functionality. if a dict have key 1 (int) the even if we try to access values by giving '1' (1 as str) as key, we should get the same result and vice versa.

Write a class FlexibleDict upon builtin dict class with above required functionality.

Hint- dict[key] => dict.__getitem__(key)



Ex.
fd = FlexibleDict()
fd['a'] = 100
print(fd['a']) # Like regular dict

fd[5] = 500
print(fd[5]) # Like regular dict

fd[1] = 100
print(fd['1']) # actual Key is int but still trying to access through str key.
fd['1'] = 100
print(fd[1])

Output:

100
500
100
100
