Polymorphism : means having multiple faces
means when the same thing behaves differently when different situations occur.

3 main concepts in polymorpshism : 

1) Method Overriding -> seen in inheritence
2) Method Overloading
3) Operator Overloading

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Method Overloading :
when a single class ,has multiple methods with the same name , but both methods behave differently depending on the input.

example usecase : 
if a class has 2 methods called as area , and if one method takes radius as a parameter and other takes length and breadth as a parameter , then different area methods will be executed depending on the input we give

what problem does method overloading solves ? 
-> the code becomes more clean while reading 

BUT 
**Method overloading does not work in python**
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Operator overloading: 
means when the same operator behaves differently when different inputs are given 

eg -> '+' operator
if we use on integers -> they add 
if we use on strings  -> they concat
if we use on lists    -> they merge
